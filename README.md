# Azure-Powered-Hybrid-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Mental-Health-Assessment
In today’s digital landscape, the expression of emotions has evolved beyond traditional text, incorporating emojis, sarcasm, and implicit cues that pose a challenge for conventional sentiment analysis systems. This study proposes hybrid architecture leveraging Azure’s sentiment analysis and custom text classification tools to perform a two-layer sentiment and mental health assessment. The model begins by classifying user-submitted sentences into positive, neutral, or negative categories using Azure Sentiment Analysis. Sentences identified as negative are further analyzed by Azure Custom Text Classification to detect deeper clinical sentiments related to mental health. Our system excels at interpreting nuanced expressions, including emojis and sarcastic phrases, ensuring more accurate sentiment detection and response. A key feature is its user complaint tracking system, which is designed to identify recurring patterns and provide technicians with past responses for rapid resolution. All data is stored securely for future clinical referencing and trend analysis. This work offers comparative analysis with pre-existing models, showcasing superior accuracy and contextual understanding. The results affirm that our architecture enhances the precision of sentiment detection and offers practical benefits for early detection and mental health support, making it a valuable advancement in intelligent emotional computing and healthcare AI solutions.
